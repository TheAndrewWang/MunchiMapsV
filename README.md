This version of MunchiMaps (MunchiMapsV) is a conversion of the site to Svelte currently being done by Andrew Wang & Vincent Huang.
This brings the following benefits:
1. Removal of previous redundant code
2. Better organization of code & more readable for future coders
3. Many aspects (especially the map) are easier to use for users
